too many classes?
modules share too many imports and exports
DOM code is too nested
task logic has so many separate functions
my naming is confusing - too much similar stuff
too many loops, how to avoid?
is it okay to rely heavily on data attributes in this instance, or was there an easier way?
does dom manipulation always look so messy, with all of this class and attribute adding? should I be adding that stiff in a more efficient way?
