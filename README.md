Stuff I still have to do:


BASIC FORMATTING:

-lock width of screen so elements don't overlap

-can't lock maxlength with textarea

-populate newTaskForm dropdowns after addNewItem

-lock task name field at 25 characters

-stop filter menu and content-div form overlapping with smaller width viewport

    -change format of filter options completely?


IMPORTANT FEATURES:

-write proper README file

-basic media queries


NICE-TO-HAVE FUNCTIONALITY:

-add navigation into specific categories

-create custom alerts for delete and help

-add content to help menu

-allow users to change order of edit lists

-add edit links to calendar to edit tasks from there


CODE RESTRUCTURING:

-is there a way to not repeat addEl, toggleHidden, etc

-figure out what to do about sortTaskList being in index.js

-refactor to use less passing variables between modules

-rewrite DOM using everything I learned so it is simpler and sleeker and easier to work with
