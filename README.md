Stuff I still have to do:

-lock width of screen so elements don't overlap
-CAN'T WRAP with input, can't lock maxlength with textarea!
//populate newTaskForm dropdowns after addNewItem
//lock task name field at 25 characters

//edit README
//basic media queries

//add navigation into specific categories

//create custom alerts for delete and help
//have categories populate new columns when list gets longer
//is there a way to not repeat addEl, toggleHidden, etc
//figure out what to do about sortTaskList being in index.js
//add content to help menu
//allow users to change order of edit lists
//refactor to use less passing variables between modules

//add edit links to calendar to edit tasks form there
